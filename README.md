RRCGAN is a deep generative model using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) cmobined with a Regressor to generate molecules with targeted properties. It is puerly run in Python. Using GPU is necessary, otherwise the running takes a lot!

# Overview
``RRCGAN`` aims to be a comprehensive independence testing package including commonly used independence tests and additional functionality such as two sample independence testing and a novel random forest-based independence test. These tests are not only included to benchmark MGC but to have a convenient location for users if they would prefer to utilize those tests instead. The package utilizes a simple class structure to enhance usability while also allowing easy extension of the package for developers. The package can be installed on all major platforms (e.g. BSD, GNU/Linux, OS X, Windows)from Python Package Index (PyPI) and GitHub.
